Autobahn WebSockets for Android
-------------------------------

Autobahn WebSockets for Android provides a client library implementation
of the WebSockets protocol:

   * very good standards conformance [1]
   * easy to use API [2]
   * designed to work with Android UI applications [3]
   * Open-source (Apache 2 license)

[1] The implementation suuports the WebSockets protocol draft version 10-14 and
    passes all tests from the Autobahn WebSockets test suite.

[2] The basic API is modeled after the WebSockets JavaScript API for
    ease of use and familarity.

[3] The API enables the use of common Android idioms for event handling (using
    anonymous inner classes) and integrates with Android UI applications (by
    communicating via messages and message loops between the UI thread and back-
    ground reader/writer threads).


RPC/PubSub
