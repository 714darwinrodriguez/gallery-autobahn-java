# AutobahnAndroid

**Autobahn**|Android is a subproject of the [Autobahn project](http://autobahn.ws/) and provides an open-source implementation

* **[The WebSocket Protocol](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455)**
* **[The Web Application Messaging Protocol (WAMP)](http://wamp.ws/)**

for Android.

WebSocket allows [bidirectional real-time messaging on the Web](http://tavendo.com/blog/post/websocket-why-what-can-i-use-it/).

WAMP provides asynchronous **Remote Procedure Calls** and **Publish & Subscribe** for applications in *one* protocol.

WAMP is ideal for distributed, multi-client and server applications, such as multi-user database-drive business applications, sensor networks (IoT), instant messaging or MMOGs (massively multi-player online games) .

> Note: **Autobahn**|Android implements version 1 of WAMP. Current versions of the other Autobahn project libraries already provide implementations of version 2 of the protocol, with substantially expanded capabilities. An update to **Autobahn**|Android is under development.

## Features

* library for WebSocket and WAMP clients
* implements WebSocket RFC6455, Draft Hybi-10+ and WAMP v1
* works on Android 2.2+
* very good standards conformance
* high-performance asynchronous design
* easy to use API
* seamless integration in Android UI apps
* no (really none) network activity on UI thread
* Open-source (Apache 2 license)

You can use AutobahnAndroid to create native Android apps talking to WebSocket servers or any WAMP compatible server.
